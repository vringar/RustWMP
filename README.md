# RustWPM

This is a toy project attempting to rewrite [OpenWPM](https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM) 
in Rust to get a better understanding of both rustlang and OpenWPM.

## First Steps

Reimplement the basic structure of
1. TaskManager
2. Browser
3. DataAggregator

However I want to use websockets instead of unix sockets.
